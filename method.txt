Guidelines (basically, follow these or you get a hold):

-BUY ONLY PHYSICAL ITEMS THAT ARE GIFT ABLE AND CAN SHIP TO YOUR HOUSE, OR AMAZON PAY SUPPORTED OFF-SITE (so not on Amazon) ITEMS. DO NOT BUY DIGITAL ITEMS OR GIFTCARDS.
 Suggested Purchases:
    - First Purchase should be less than 50$
    - Second Purchase should be less than 100$
    - Third Purchase should be less than 150$
    - Fourth Purchase should be less than 250$
    - Fifth Purchase should be less than 500$
    - 6th Purchase and on can be any amount.

-After making an order, wait 2 to 3 days after the item actually ships (i.e you have it in your hands) to your house/location before making another purchase.
-Have consistent activity. This is a big one. Browsing Amazon every day for a few minutes (like 20 or so), adding items to your cart and removing them, debating between purchases, and showing general engagement can up your chances of this working.
-BUY ONLY GIFTABLE ITEMS. A fast way to check this is, go to an amazon item, look at its purchase section, and find an option labeled "Add a gift receipt for easy returns." These items ARE giftable and are purchasable on the card. If you don't do this and get a hold, maybe you should've listened.
-Buy Items from your List. Steps are below:
    -To add an item to your list, navigate to that item and scroll down until you see the "Add to list" option.
    -Then, just click add to list/hit the arrow and add it to a custom list you made via the icon there.
    -To navigate to your list, hit the "account" icon at the top right and hit "Your lists".
    - Then, open up your list you have added the item you want to purchase.
    - Now, click add to cart FROM THE LIST PAGE. After that, the button should change into "Proceed to checkout." Click that. (note, you can also hit "This is a gift" on the same page to save some time that way.)
    - Now, go through the normal purchasing steps. These are very easy to follow, and when prompted to make the item a gift do so.
    - Now, after selecting its shipping location you can hit "place order" and you'll be good to go!
    -Pro Tip: Remove any actual cards you have on your amazon acc so that if you do get a hold, its not locked in there if you can't unhold it.
HOW TO ORDER AND MAKE IT WORK
WORK ONLY WITH AMAZON.COM
 
YOUR ORDER CAN BE Deleted logically, reason why price is low.
 
(Make sure your Amazon.com account aged enough 6month+ and with atleast 1 order)
 
=====================================
 
 
BEFORE ORDERING
 
First of all go ahead and add your card to your account clicking "add debit or credit card". Enter the numbers I gave you and enter your accounts name on the name box. You dont need exp date or anything else. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY click "do not finance" or "%5 cashback" instead of 12 or 6 Month Finance. ( you can go ahead and change that from ur payment method details on ur amazon)
 
When you are placing the order DO NOT use VPN. And order from your device that you used to make all your orders. If your IP address is different Amazon will instantly cancel your order and lock the account. Basically dont change your account's default settings.
 
After added card, wait 14-21 days, after you can order! (This step will incrase a lot success rate of order)
 
=====================================
 
 
WHEN AMAZON BANS YOUR ACCOUNT (NOT ON HOLD, THE SOFT BAN)
 
If Amazon bans your account its most likely 2-hour ban which means you can still order your stuff when you unlock your Amazon. Amazon banned you for 2 hours because  they thought it wasnt under your authorization. So after you unlock and order again you should call them and say that it was you ordering and you authorize the order and dont want the order to get cancelled/account to get banned.
 
One important thing is sometimes Amazon lock your account for 72 hours but they dont cancel your order. So simply go check your mobile Amazon app and if order is still there then your order might get shipped even tho your Amazon is locked.
 
=====================================
 
BEST WAY TO ORDER AFTER AMAZON UNLOCKS YOUR ACCOUNT (when u get unbanned softy and still have access)
 
1) Add the card back to the account and wait 12-24 hours without ordering so you can age the card.
2) Go for Same-Day or 1-Day Shipping (2 day at most) (depends on your region)
 
If you dont follow any of these steps you see up there and rush into ordering $3000 worth of stuff without following anything then your order will get cancelled and you will not receive any support from us.
Always remember that you are buying this shit for a dirt cheap and not everyone will succeed but our goal is to make this shit work for everyone.
 
TRY DOING SMALL ORDERS FIRST (Under $25 including shipping)! (FOLLOW THE INCREMENTS)
